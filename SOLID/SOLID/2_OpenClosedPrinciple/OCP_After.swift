 ## Open-Closed Principle
 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)

 "Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification."

 A class is closed, since it may be compiled, stored in a library, baselined, and used by client classes. But it is also open, since any new class may use it as parent, adding new features. When a descendant class is defined, there is no need to change the original or to disturb its clients.
