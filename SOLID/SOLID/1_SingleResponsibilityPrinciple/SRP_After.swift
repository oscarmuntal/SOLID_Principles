 ## Single Responsibility Principle
 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)

 "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."
 
A module or a class should have only one responsibility, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by that module/class.
