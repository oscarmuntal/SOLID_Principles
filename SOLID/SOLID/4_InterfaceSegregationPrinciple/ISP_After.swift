 ### Interface Segregation Principle
 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)
 
 "A Client should not be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use."
 
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use. No code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
